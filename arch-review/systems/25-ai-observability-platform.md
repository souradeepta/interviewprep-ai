# AI Model Observability & Monitoring Platform

## TL;DR
Monitors AI system performance: model drift, data drift, cost tracking. Real-time dashboards + alerts.

## Problem Statement
AI systems degrade silently. Need comprehensive observability.

## Requirements

### Functional
- Metric collection
- Drift detection
- Cost tracking
- Alerting

### Non-Functional (Scale Targets)
- Models tracked: 100+
- Drift detection: <1% false positive
- Latency: <1 min

## Envelope Calculation
100 models × $100/month = $10K/month.

## Component Breakdown
- Core components and their responsibilities
- Latency and cost breakdown per component

## AI/ML Integration Points
- Where LLM/ML models are used
- Model selection and routing logic
- Cost optimization strategies

## Key Trade-offs
| Aspect | Option A | Option B | Choice | Rationale |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Speed vs Quality | Fast (basic) | Slow (advanced) | Balanced | Trade-off based on SLA |
| Cost vs Accuracy | Cheap model | Expensive model | Optimal mix | Cost-effective with acceptable accuracy |

## Interview Q&A

**Q1: How do you scale this system from current to 10x volume?**

A: Identify bottleneck (usually inference or storage). Auto-scaling: add GPUs for model serving, replicate databases, implement caching at retrieval layer. Example: for 10x compute, scale from 8 A100s to 80 A100s with load balancing.

**Q2: What's the cost optimization strategy as volume grows?**

A: Batch processing where possible (saves 50%), model distillation (cheaper inference), caching (reduce LLM calls), negotiate volume discounts with cloud providers. Target: cost per request drops 30-50% at 10x scale.

**Q3: How do you handle model failures or hallucinations?**

A: Confidence thresholds (only auto-act if confidence >0.95), human review queue for uncertain cases, validation checks (does output make sense?), continuous monitoring with alerts if error rate increases.

**Q4: What metrics do you track for system health?**

A: Latency (P50, P99), error rate, cost per request, model accuracy, throughput, user satisfaction. Dashboard updated real-time. Alert if latency >2x SLA or accuracy drops >5%.

**Q5: Privacy and compliance: how do you protect user data?**

A: Data minimization (keep only necessary data), encryption in transit + at rest, RBAC for access, audit logs. For regulated domains (medical, financial), additional: data residency, compliance certifications, annual penetration testing.

**Q6: Multi-region deployment: latency vs cost trade-off?**

A: Deploy in 3-5 regions, route user to closest region (100ms latency savings). Cost: ~3x infrastructure. Benefit: global coverage + disaster recovery. For most systems, worth it.

**Q7: Monitoring model drift: how do you detect performance degradation?**

A: Continuous evaluation on production data (10% sample). Weekly accuracy report. If accuracy drops >2%, alert and investigate (data drift, model bug, or expected variation). Retrain if needed.

**Q8: Cost target vs reality: if you're 2x over budget, what do you do?**

A: (1) Cheaper model (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4): 10x cost reduction, 15% accuracy drop. (2) Caching (save 30%). (3) More selective LLM usage (only for hard cases). (4) Volume discounts. Target: get to 1.1-1.2x budget.
